Alex Baldwin, whose dieing mediocre career was saved by his impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing DJT was agony for him.
Alex, it was also agony for those who were forced to watch.
You were terrible.
Bring back Darrell Hammond, much funnier and a far greater talent!

Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world.
We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer.
We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!

Background Checks a big part of conversation.
Gun free zones are proven targets of killers.

Today we honor Billy Graham as only three private citizens before him have been honored.
We say a prayer for our country: that all across this land, the Lord will raise up men and women like Billy Graham to spread a message of love and hope to every precious child of God.

Starting at a small Bible School in Florida, Billy Graham soon led a nationwide revival.

Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse.
Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc.
Isn’t the I.G.
an Obama guy?
Why not use Justice Department lawyers?
DISGRACEFUL!

The Heritage Foundation has just stated that 64% of the Trump Agenda is already done, faster than even Ronald Reagan.
“We’re blown away,” said Thomas Binion of Heritage, President Trump “is very active, very conservative and very effective.
Huge volume &amp; spectrum of issues.”

Big legal win today.
U.S. judge sided with the Trump Administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great Border Wall on the Southern Border.

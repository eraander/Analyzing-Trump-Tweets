Get the vote out in California today for Rep. Kevin McCarthy and all of the great GOP candidates for Congress.
Keep our country out of the hands of High Tax, High Crime Nancy Pelosi.

Separating families at the Border is the fault of bad legislation passed by the Democrats.
Border Security laws should be changed but the Dems can’t get their act together!
Started the Wall.

The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn’t tell me he was going to recuse himself...I would have quickly picked someone else.
So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!

We have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots, Alabama and Clemson National Champions, and many others.
National Anthem &amp; more great music today at 3:00 P.M.

We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M., The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus.
Honoring America!
NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms!

The U.S. has an increased economic value of more than 7 Trillion Dollars since the Election.
May be the best economy in the history of our country.
Record Jobs numbers.
Nice!

What is taking so long with the Inspector General’s Report on Crooked Hillary and Slippery James Comey.
Numerous delays.
Hope Report is not being changed and made weaker!
There are so many horrible things to tell, the public has the right to know.
Transparency!

The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House.
Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event.
Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling.
Sorry!

In many ways this is the greatest economy in the HISTORY of America and the best time EVER to look for a job!

The Fake News Media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony Russian Witch Hunt.

The appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL!
Despite that, we play the game because I, unlike the Democrats, have done nothing wrong!

Farmers have not been doing well for 15 years.
Mexico, Canada, China and others have treated them unfairly.
By the time I finish trade talks, that will change.
Big trade barriers against U.S. farmers, and other businesses, will finally be broken.
Massive trade deficits no longer!

To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference.
Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State...No way!
Remember Alabama.
Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!

Our high level delegation is on the way back from China where they had long meetings with Chinese leaders and business representatives.
We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results, but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins!

Just returned home to the beautiful White House, from Dallas, where the Arena was packed to the rafters with the great fans and supporters of the @NRA.
It was so wonderful to be there!

Great book just out by very successful businessman @AndyPuzder.
Always known as somebody who knows how to win, “Capitalist Comeback” will be a big hit!

I want to thank all of our friends and patriots at the @NRA.
We will never fail, and we will always protect your Second Amendment!
God Bless you, and God Bless America!

We are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR.
Illegal immigration must end!

Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets.
Politicians who put criminal aliens before American Citizens should be voted out of office!

All of us here today are united by the same timeless values.
We believe that our liberty is a gift from our creator, and that no Government can ever take it away.
We believe in the rule of law - and we support the men and women of law enforcement.
We have pride in our history... https://t.co/eONj1Y8oju

JUST OUT: 3.9% Unemployment.
4% is Broken!
In the meantime, WITCH HUNT!

NBC NEWS is wrong again!
They cite “sources” which are constantly wrong.
Problem is, like so many others, the sources probably don’t exist, they are fabricated, fiction!
NBC, my former home with the Apprentice, is now as bad as Fake News CNN.
Sad!

Because Jobs in the U.S. are doing so well, Americans receiving unemployment aid is the lowest since 1973.
Great!

Our Southern Border is under siege.
Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws.
Must build a Wall.
Mexico, which has a massive crime problem, is doing little to help!

This spring marks 4yrs since the Phoenix VA crisis.
We won't forget what happened to our GREAT VETS.
Choice is vital, but the program needs work &amp; is running out of $.
Congress must fix Choice Program by Memorial Day so VETS can get the care they deserve.
I will sign immediately!

...despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair.
Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement.
Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction.

...very common among celebrities and people of wealth.
In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford (Daniels).
The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair,......

Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA.
These agreements are.....

Our great financial team is in China trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade!
I look forward to being with President Xi in the not too distant future.
We will always have a good (great) relationship!

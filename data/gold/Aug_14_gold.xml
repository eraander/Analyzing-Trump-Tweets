When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn’t work out.
Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!

Lou Dobbs: “This cannot go forward...this Special Councel with all of his conflicts, with his 17 Angry Democrats, without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia.
The Dems are the ones who should be investigated.” Thank you Lou, so true!

....should be shut down.
The Strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt.
It should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors.” Thank you Judicial Watch, I couldn’t have said it better myself!

....guy was corrupt and had anti-Trump animus.
Strzok and others at the FBI should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation.
Instead, Mueller is pretending nothing went wrong.
He used Strzok, he used the Clinton DNC Dossier...the whole thing....

Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch: “The Strzok firing is as much about the Mueller operation as anything else.
There would be no Mueller Special Councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of Strzok &amp; his colleagues at the top levels of the FBI.
We know this...

....such wonderful and powerful things about me - a true Champion of Civil Rights - until she got fired.
Omarosa had Zero credibility with the Media (they didn’t want interviews) when she worked in the White House.
Now that she says bad about me, they will talk to her.
Fake News!

@MarkBurnettTV called to say that there are NO TAPES of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by Wacky and Deranged Omarosa.
I don’t have that word in my vocabulary, and never have.
She made it up.
Look at her MANY recent quotes saying....

Scott Walker of Wisconsin is a tremendous Governor who has done incredible things for that Great State.
He has my complete &amp; total Endorsement!
He brought the amazing Foxconn to Wisconsin with its 15,000 Jobs-and so much more.
Vote for Scott on Tuesday in the Republican Primary!

It was my great honor to sign our new Defense Bill into law and to pay tribute to the greatest soldiers in the history of the world: THE U.S. ARMY.
The National Defense Authorization Act is the most significant investment in our Military and our warfighters in modern history!

Vote for Pete tomorrow.

Brooks Koepka just won his third Golf Major, and he did it not only with his powerful game, but with his powerful mind.
He has been a man of steel on the Tour and will have many Victories, including Majors, ahead of him.
Congrats to Brooks and his great team on a job well done!

Just fired Agent Strzok, formerly of the FBI, was in charge of the Crooked Hillary Clinton sham investigation.
It was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone!

Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally.
The list of bad players in the FBI &amp; DOJ gets longer &amp; longer.
Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped?
It is a total Hoax.
No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back!

California Governor Jerry Brown is doing the right thing and sending the National Guard to the Border.

If I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December, as reported by the Failing New York Times, I would have fired him.
Just more Fake News from a biased newspaper!

Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question.
We are with you Paul!

Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake &amp; Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama.
Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA &amp; Comey letter).
No Collusion, so they go crazy!

Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War.
There is no reason for this.
Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together.
Stop the arms race?

Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.
Get ready Russia,  because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart!” You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!

....doing things that nobody thought possible, despite the never ending and corrupt Russia Investigation, which takes tremendous time and focus.
No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back), so now they do the Unthinkable, and RAID a lawyers office for information!
BAD!

So much Fake News about what is going on in the White House.
Very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with China, the coming North Korea meeting and, of course, the vicious gas attack in Syria.
Feels great to have Bolton &amp; Larry K on board.
I (we) are

The Failing New York Times wrote another phony story.
It was political pundit Doug Schoen, not a Ukrainian businessman, who asked me to do a short speech by phone (Skype), hosted by Doug, in Ukraine.
I was very positive about Ukraine-another negative to the Fake Russia  C story!

Last night, it was my great honor to host America’s senior defense and military leaders for dinner at the White House.
America’s military is the GREATEST fighting force in the history of the world.
They all have my pledge of unwavering commitment to our men and women in uniform!

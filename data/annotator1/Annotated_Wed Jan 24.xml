Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no Wall, there is no DACA.
We must have safety and security, together with a strong Military, for our great people!

Where are the 50,000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok?
Blaming Samsung!

Thank you to General John Kelly, who is doing a fantastic job, and all of the Staff and others in the White House, for a job well done.
Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult, but it is always great to WIN, and few have won more than us!

Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans &amp; Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security.
The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!

In one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts, perhaps 50,000, and all in prime time.
Wow!

Even Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees: “Trump World and WH sources dancing in end zone: Trump wins again...Schumer and Dems caved...gambled and lost.” Thank you for your honesty Jim!

Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown.
Now I want a big win for everyone, including Republicans, Democrats and DACA, but especially for our Great Military and Border Security.
Should be able to get there.
See you at the negotiating table!

Democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base.
They don’t want to do it but are powerless!

The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens.
Not good!

Thank you to Brad Blakeman on @FoxNews for grading year one of my presidency with an “A”-and likewise to Doug Schoen for the very good grade and statements.
Working hard!

Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border.
The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked.
If stalemate continues, Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real, long term budget, no C.R.’s!

The Trump Administration has terminated more UNNECESSARY Regulation, in just twelve months, than any other Administration has terminated during their full term in office, no matter what the length.
The good news is, THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME!

Unprecedented success for our Country, in so many ways, since the Election.
Record Stock Market, Strong on Military, Crime, Borders, &amp; ISIS, Judicial Strength &amp; Numbers, Lowest Unemployment for Women &amp; ALL, Massive Tax Cuts, end of Individual Mandate - and so much more.
Big 2018!

Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall.
It is just a down payment.
Work will start immediately.
The rest of the money will come - and remember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!

Because of the $700 &amp; $716 Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military, many jobs are created and our Military is again rich.
Building a great Border Wall, with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country, is all about National Defense.
Build WALL through M!

France honors a great hero.
Officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in ISIS related terror attack.
So much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical Islamic terrorism.
Even stronger measures needed, especially at borders!

Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in France yesterday, and we grieve the nation’s loss.
We also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support.
We are with you @EmmanuelMacron!

As a matter of National Security I've signed the Omnibus Spending Bill.
I say to Congress: I will NEVER sign another bill like this again.
To prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills!

Obama Administration legalized bump stocks.
BAD IDEA.
As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period.
We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.

I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.

DACA was abandoned by the Democrats.
Very unfair to them!
Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall.

I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor.
I am very thankful for the service of General H.R.
McMaster who has done an outstanding job &amp; will always remain my friend.
There will be an official contact handover on 4/9.

As a candidate, I pledged that if elected I would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade, protect American workers, and defend our national security.
Today, we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment.

Remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary’s large and highly sophisticated staff.
Well, not saying that anymore!

Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy.
Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault.
He doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way.
Don’t threaten people Joe!

Democrats refused to take care of DACA.
Would have been so easy, but they just didn’t care.
I had to fight for Military and start of Wall.

Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming.
Most importantly, got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military, $716 Billion next year...most ever.
Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.

.....They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race.
Bush tried to get along, but didn’t have the “smarts.” Obama and Clinton tried, but didn’t have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET).
PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!

I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also).
The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him.
They are wrong!
Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.......

“Special Council is told to find crimes, whether a crime exists or not.
I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council.
I am still opposed to it.
I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because.....
